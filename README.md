# Welcome

I am Samu Karesma and this is my GitHub page. I am a Business Information student as well as a gamer and a modder.

I have done several mods for different mods for different games and played around with others' mods even more.
On this site I am going to share some of my mods and work. Feel free to take look around!

### I am available for hire!

I am currently carrying out my studies of Bachelor of Business Information Technology at HÃ¤me University of Applied Sciences. I am on my last stretch of my studies, and I have only the intership left. If you, or you know someone who would, need an IT intern, I am available!
